# Genetic-Algorithms

Goal:
- The goal of this assignment was to solve a simple mathematical game with the help of the genetic algorithms. 
- In this mathematical game, you are given a set of numbers, a set of mathematical operators and a target number. 
- Your goal is then to arrange the numbers and mathematical operators in such manner that the result of the equation is as close or even identical as the target number.
